* wakefield

An STM32f7 discovery board synthesizer capable of running and controlling compiled puredata patches.


based on the ARM / STM32F7 DIY synth workshop by thi-ng (https://github.com/thi-ng/ws-ldn-12)

uses enzienaudio's (https://enzienaudio.com) online puredata patch compiler

** Features

- Hardware MIDI over DIN (I'm using the MIDI shield from sparkfun)
- Hardware accelerated wavetable oscillator, generates up to 32 oscillators simultaneously

** Project setup

This repo contains 8 sub-projects, originating from the STM32 workshop. The xakefield project is also a subproject.

*IMPORTANT:* The =Makefile= requires the env var =STM_CUBE_HOME= to be
set to the root of your STM SDK directory, e.g.
=~/dev/arm/STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.4.0=.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  export STM_CUBE_HOME=~/dev/arm/STM32Cube_FW_F7_V1.4.0

  make module=xakefield clean
  make module=xakefield

  # flash device (0x800000 is ROM start address)
  cp bin/wakefield/app.bin /Volumes/DIS_F746NG/

#+END_SRC
